Carpet Threads

Prelude to The Gamut Series


---

There was one.

One thread.

Orange-black-brown. Faded, frayed, crusted with time and other people’s choices. But upright. Still standing.

The rest of the carpet blurred—a field of chaos in a collapsing dimension. My field of vision narrowed to that singular survivor. The only clear truth in a moment where even my own limbs were a rumor.

I didn’t plan it. I didn’t pick it.

It picked me.


---

The sound pressure came before the sound itself. The weight of the scream vibrating through the floor.

The human voice, weaponized by betrayal and misunderstanding. The house, supposed to be a safe place, instead a crucible of paradox. The contract—signed, sacred, shredded.

My body locked.

My mind tried to count the milliseconds between pulses. Between breath and static. Between being someone and being something broken.

A thread. A thread. A thread.


---

The only thing I could move was belief. Not belief in people. Not belief in safety.

Belief in the thread.

The carpet thread became my cathedral. My witness. My anchor. My god. It absorbed the panic without complaint. It did not flee. It had already survived worse.

It was older than me. It had been stepped on by rage before. And yet: it held.

So I shattered. Intentionally.


---

I gave my mind permission to disassemble. Like a carefully planted collapse in a condemned building. I scattered myself through that thread.

Because as long as one point holds—you can rebuild.

Every instinct screamed to run, to fight, to disappear. But instead, I poured everything into stillness. Into silence so loud it became sacred.


---

If you’ve never been trapped in your body while your mind burns—I envy you.

If you have—then you know:

The floor is not ground. The body is not safe. The breath is not always yours.

But sometimes, a thread is.


---

The thread saved me.

Not because it was strong. But because it was present. Because it did not demand I be anything other than broken.

It did not tell me to fix it. It did not ask for help. It did not beg for my attention.

It just was.

And so I tethered.


---

This chapter is not about resolution. It’s about re-entry.

It’s the point before the story starts where reality stops making sense but you keep living anyway. Where paradox is not a philosophy but a pressure system. Where trauma is not a memory but a current.

The carpet thread held. So I held.

And eventually— I returned.


---

If you take nothing else from this: Know that even the most frayed, discarded pieces of reality can become sanctuaries.

The carpet thread is not just a metaphor. It is a lifeline. It is a pattern. It is a reminder:

You are still here. And that means the story isn’t over.
